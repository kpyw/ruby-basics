# CHALLENGES:
#
# Can you simulate a hand of blackjack?
#
# 1. Randomly choose two cards from a standard deck of 52 cards.
# HINT: Don't worry about the suits.  Just the card value/face matters.
# HINT: Arrays have a #sample method that can (optionally) accept a parameter.
#
# Example Output #1:
# 5 8
#
# Example Output #2:
# Q 6
#
# Example Output #3:
# 2 A

cards = %w(2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 J Q K A) *4
# puts cards.sample(2)




# 2. Enhance #1 by showing the total score.
# HINT: Consider all aces to have a value of 11.
# Example Output #1:
#
# 5 8
# You have 13.
#
# Example Output #2:
# Q 6
# You have 16.
#
# Example Output #3:
# 2 A
# You have 13.

# hand1=cards.sample
# hand2=cards.sample
# hand = [hand1, hand2]
2.times do |hand|
  hand=cards.sample
  puts "your first card is a " + hand
  if hand == "A"
    cardval=11
    elsif hand.to_i == 0
    cardval=10
    else cardval=hand
    puts cardval
    end
end







# 3. Enhance #2 by adding a card if the score is less than 17.
# Example Output #1:
# 2 A 6
# You have 19.

# Example Output #1:
# Q A
# You have 20.






# 4. Enhance #3 by displaying a message if the score is over 21.
# Example Output #1:
# 7 A 6
# You have 24.
# You're busted!







# 5. Enhance #4 by considering an Ace to be 1 if it would prevent
# the total score from going over 21.
# Example Output #1:
# 4 A 9
# You have 14.
